    <p>Eltjo van Gulik is a Principal Product Manager for HDX Graphics & Seamless at Citrix, directing the vision and strategy for the Citrix HDX Graphics domain. Eltjo has over two decades of experience in the End User Computing domain.</p>
    <p>He is recognised as a former CTP, and his community contributions span blogging, public speaking at international events like Citrix Synergy, and participating in other community-driven initiatives like GO-EUC, a platform that he founded together with Ryan Ververs-Bijkerk.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, he is a proud father and husband. And as a self-proclaimed beer and coffee aficionado, he prefers Russian Imperial Stouts, and the distinct tastes of Brasil/Costa Rica Arabica blends for his coffee.</p>
    <p>In his spare time, Eltjo is an avid Dungeons and Dragons player. Only 3rd edition though, because the newer versions suck (did we mention that Eltjo is slightly pedantic yet?)</p>
    <p>His friends often label him as social, slightly pedantic, and suitably lazy.</p>
