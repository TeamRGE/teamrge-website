        <td width="925">In today’s world, where businesses have fully embraced the power of chatbots and Large Language Models (LLMs), many forget the risk of feeding public AI services with sensitive data. Organizations that do see the risk and choose to run LLMs in their own datacenter experience challenges because MLops teams have trouble to scale their infrastructure. This is where the newly announced VMware Private AI Foundation, that includes VMware vSphere with Tanzu and NVIDIA AI Enterprise, can help. In this session, Johan van Amersfoort (ITQ) will explain the basics of AI, the risks of using public AI services, the added value of VMware Private AI Foundation, show LIVE demos, and will introduce the world to Project COBIE. A must-see session for anyone who would like to kickstart their own Private AI Journey!</td>
